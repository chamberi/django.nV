##A1 - Injection

###Exposure
We found an instance of [vulnerability 1] by typing some relevant code into some vulnerable field OR by doing some edge-case thing.

By exploiting [this vulnerability], we were able to retrieve XYZ attributes from the site / access to some unauthorized part of the site / something else valuable.

###Repair
problem_file1.py and problem_file2.py contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

problem_file1.py
```
Some body of relevant code that solves our problem
```
problem_file2.py

```
Some body of relevant code that solves our problem
```

##A2 - Broken Auth

##A3 - XSS

##A4 - Insecure Direct Object Reference (DOR)

A direct object reference is likely to occur when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key without any validation mechanism which will allow attackers to manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.

### Exposure
By choosing a route with an id we were able to go to forms and perform POST requests for tasks that weren't our own.

For example the routes
`/taskManager/1/project_delete/`
`/taskManager/1/edit_project/` 
`/taskManager/1/upload/`

We were able to delete, edit and upload projects without actually owning the project, just by typing in the URL.

### Repair
Check user is Authenticated for tasks in the `views.py` function, and don't allow unauthenticated users access to the website.

Using django's `user.is_authenticated()` method in the `views.py` can check if the user is logged in. `user.has_permission()` checks if the user belongs to a particular permission group.

The views that have this vulnerability will have to be updated with these methods, an example below is for the `project_delete` view. 

```Python
def project_delete(request, project_id):

    if user.has_permission('delete'):
        project = Project.objects.get(pk=project_id)
        project.delete()
        return redirect('/taskManager/dashboard')
```
